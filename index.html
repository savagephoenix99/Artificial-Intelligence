            <b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

            So, What does that mean??
        </h3>

        <p style="font-family:Verdana; color:lime;">
            You can say, that Artificial Intelligence is intelligence we have created as humans that is usually "given" to robots or machines. So it can be called the consciousness of robots or machines.

            Then, What can we use it for?
        </h3>

        <p style="font-family:Verdana; color:lime;">
            Well AI can be programmed to do many things. It can do household chores for example. It will also impact many jobs. Taxi/bus/aeroplane drivers may be robots in the near future. But right now, as of the moment AI is pretty much useless. Current AI robots cannot even solve a <strong>simple high school test!</strong>
